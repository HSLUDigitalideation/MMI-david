### Description
Schoolproject (HSLU Digital Ideation IDA Modul 114) to monitor my personal Fitbit-data over a website. Get the data through OAuth 2.0 by php and show it more or less «live» on the site. For the communication between the user of the site and me, I created a messaging service with telegram.
